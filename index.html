                    Previously at CMU, UPenn, and UCLA I worked on cryptography (including zkSNARKs, MPC, PIR, and ORAM). I switched to work on AI Safety because I think it is super interesting and extremely important! I help out with <a href="https://cmuaisafety.com/">CASI</a>.

                        We give MGigaDORAM, the first implemented maliciously secure DORAM. Although its stricter security model, MGigaDORAM is only 4x (currently estimated) slower then most efficient semi-honest DORAM (GigaDORAM). Leveraging MGigaDORAM, we extend the replicated MPC of Lindell et al (<a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/570">[CGHI]</a>) to a RAM-MPC. We show that our RAM-MPC is over 100x faster than previous implementations (which were all semi-honest). We make our implementation open-source and integrate it to Xiao Wang’s <a href="https://github.com/emp-toolkit">EMP-toolkit</a>, allowing non-expert users of the framework to execute MPC computations in the RAM model.<br>

            <h4 class="section-title">Academic Interests</h4>

            <p>At large, even though I am primarily computer science and mathematics, I would claim to be fascinated
                with
                philosophy, and physics. At this early point of my academic journey, I don’t feel quite comfortable
                stating
                specific (aimed) areas of work or expertise, particularly seeing that I can’t help to enjoy every single
                course I take and frantically curious about any technical term I hear, but, for those interested in some
                further categorization, I am mostly interested in “pure-ish” areas lying in the intersection of maths
                and
                cs
                such as complexity, cryptography, and algorithms.
            </p>

            <p>To compensate for my high-uncertainty range about my desired field of expertise, for those out there
                still
                hoping to understand “who is Matan Shtepel?” I did my best to articulate what drives my particular
                scholarly
                curiosities, and then, my academic ambitions. The following lists may not be entirely exhaustive, but
                hey,
                they are something. If the following seems a bit romantic, well, that means you really are learning
                about me :)
            </p>

            <p>For starters, I have always, still do, and likely always will, have a deep appreciation for order, rules,
                and structure, which I now understand are the only ways to exceed our inborn biases and human notions,
                but
                more personally, I think games without rules are simply no fun -- at least not in an
                intellectual-challenge
                sense, which bring me great joy. That being said, there are few things that I find as fulfilling as
                tackling
                hard tasks, distinctly those which demand a combination of creativity and deductive reasoning. As
                painful as
                the process leading up to it often is, I find the moment in which my brain switches from the “I have no
                knowledge at all of this strange coalescence of phrases and symbols” state to “I understand!” virtually
                addicting. Beyond such practical concerns, I am driven by the beauty of subjects I am so fortunate to
                study,
                and this is tougher to describe as its not “rational” or explicit, perhaps its about admiring successful
                information compression or the awe of the achievement of my fellow ape-descendants, but when I watched a
                Bertnard Russel interview, studied the fundamentals of topology, or get the first glimpse of Turing
                Machines, my heart was just filled with incredible feeling -- truly indescribable.
            </p>

            <p>Simply (and naively) stated, I am pursuing a career in academia because I believe contributing to the
                ever-growing pool of human knowledge and training others to do the same is the most noble way I can
                spend my
                life/finite time on this earth, and beyond, as far as my limited predictive powers enable me to see, I
                think
                I will find deep happiness within that career. Being able to deeply delve into a topic without a brow
                raised
                and a “you are thinking too much” stated, is a privilege I am willing to work hard for. I must say, from
                time to time I do struggle with the infatuation of visions of fame and glory, but I do my best to stick
                to
                my purest motives and let the many reasons and experiences above determine my life-long ambitions.
                While it’s both difficult to explicitly articulate and awkward to self-state, I would say my burning
                curiosity, not quite fixated on application, chasing a paramount understanding of the space of ideas,
                and
                thirsty for an earnest challenge.
